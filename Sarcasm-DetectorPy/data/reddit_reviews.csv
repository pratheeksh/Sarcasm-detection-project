1750,Did you religiously watch Conan O'Brien's show when he was on at the later time slot?,0,0
1751,Because I did and I saw that his show was heavily fueled by sketches with supporting players who would come on and do really great bits.,0,0
1752,That was the show he developed when he had the freedom to do what he wanted to do.,0,0
1753,And so my point -- my opinion and my guess -- is that he would have liked to do the Tonight Show with a different tone and a different type of structure.,0,0
1754,But being on the Tonight Show time slot significantly constrains any comedian into doing what will appeal to middle America.,0,0
1755,I do think Conan wanted to be the guy who could do that but it's a tension between being himself and being what middle America and the bosses and shareholders at NBC want him to do at that time slot.,0,0
1756,They want him to be #1 and to do that is not always great for the quality of the comedy.,0,0

1863,"Also, do you get that in general being on network TV inherently requires the star of the show to concede some control/input to these outside people?",0,0
1864,Because being on network TV in primetime time slots requires a show to either get huge ratings or be pulled off the air?,0,0

1868,I'd have to imagine John Oliver became by far the favorite pretty recently.,0,0

1870,"Rather, his character was RW pundit satire which did not lend itself to the balance necessary to execute truly meaningful interview with political figures.",0,0

5312,"The awards just couldn't handle the idea of a show that put black people *qua* people at its center rather than as interesting ""flavor"" at the periphery, and couldn't wrap their minds around the concept that important, interesting, and dramatic things are still important, interesting, and dramatic even if they don't happen in New York or cities that are trendier or more ""up-and-coming"" than Baltimore.",0,0
5313,And 300x times as boring.,1,1
5314,Oh they are going to play together?,1,1
5315,Why am I watching this?,1,1
5316,I guess it's more interesting to me because I grew up around New Orleans. ,0,0
5317,If everyone understood it we wouldn't still have the drug war.,0,0
5318,"Oh then it must be, If nothing else Treme made me want to visit New Orleans.",0,0
5319,But there still was no sense of it going anywhere.,0,0
5320,Unlike the Wire that had a central theme of catching the drug dealers there was no unifying storyline to Treme.,0,0
5321,"(I stopped watching in the beginning of season3)

Oh and suddenly cutting John Goodman... Wtf was that...",0,0
5322,Pulp Fiction came out that year too.,0,0
5323,I like Forrest Gump but there's no way you can convince me it's better than Shawshank AND Pulp Fiction.,0,0
5324,As far as The Wire goes I just think it was ahead of it's time.,0,0
5325,If that show came out today it would be BURIED in Emmy noms. ,0,0
5326,The Sopranos is an awesome show there is no denying it and of course one of the all time best.,0,0
5327,It was also a first of its kind which puts it at a top spot just because it is genre defining.,0,0
5328,However there have been cop shows forever.,0,0
5329,What The Wire did was to redefine the genre.,0,0
5330,The Wire was the first to show a realistic image of the police dept.,0,0
5331,AND life on the streets.,0,0
5332,"People who have lived those lives will tell you just how legit it is in its depiction of how people got by and dealt with gang life, growing up in extreme poverty and a inner city war zone.",0,0
5333,The show took something that many people were unable to understand and put them right in that world.,0,0
5334,It made you care for the kids thrust into gang life due to lack of other viable choices or just out right stupidity.,0,0
5335,"The show provided a glimpse inside a police dept, political structure and media in such a way that made it much easier to understand the underlying problems and not just the ones the media decided to show to get shock value and ratings.",0,0
5336,"I agree the Sopranos is a great show but The Wire is something really special and should be required watching for anyone who wants to truly understand inner city life and the problems faced by those living there, the community and police force.",0,0
5337,I think you're dead wrong on this.,0,0
5338,"The war on drugs is a complex topic, and I think the show does an incredible job in showing the actual mechanisms behind it.",0,0
5339,"Basically, this war is still being fought because the individual institutions that *could* change something are actually profiting from it.",0,0
5340,"Politicians gain votes by being tough on drugs, police departements get more funding, lawyers specialize on defending drug criminals, and dealers couldn't have these high profit margins if they had to operate within a controlled legal framework.",0,0
5341,That's not even touching the topic of dirty money exchanging hands.,0,0
5342,"That's not the full picture, of course, but it's definitely not true that the show merely tells us that the war on drugs is wrong, but doesn't dig into the mechanisms that keep it going.",0,0
5343,Yes absolutely,0,0
5344,One thing that the show had going against it is the Emmy awards are are based off a single episode in each category.,0,0
5345,Potentially only a chunk of that episode depending on what category.,0,0
5346,Whereas the strength of The Wire really lies in the breadth and building of the story episode upon episode.,0,0
5347,The show is known for being tough to get into as it takes a few episodes to really grasp the uncompromising reality of Simon's world.,0,0
5348,So for nomination purposes sending out a screener from an episode mid-season would be a tough sell to a lot of people not already on board.,0,0
5349,The Wire is not really dijestible in chunks.,0,0
5350,"First, I *strongly* appreciate the well-thought-out reply.",0,0
5351,"My only response is that this falls into ""critical-lag"" category.",0,0
5352,It's absolutely correct that it takes a while to get into *The Wire* -- and that explains why it didn't initially gain traction among ordinary viewers.,0,0
5353,...But there are human beings who are paid money to be critics.,0,0
5354,These humans have two jobs: (1) Point out why widely-acclaimed shows are not really that good; and (2) Point out little-known shows that actually deserve attention.,0,0
5355,"With *The Wire,* the critics were asleep at the wheel; ""It's great as a series, but is initially difficult on an episode-to-episode basis"" is a great explanation for an average viewer; for a critic, it's no excuse.",0,0
5356,I don't think critics were slow to pick up on the quality of the show though.,0,0
5357,It got positive reviews from the outset but only gained 'best show' status after some years of percolation which is reasonable.,0,0
5358,"It was the public that took it's time getting on board and the fact, like you said, that the show got basically no nominations prevented a lot of people from even hearing about the show.",0,0
5359,The critical reception isn't really to blame but rather the lack of a reception from the Academy.,0,0
5360,"Also loved that the show had some impact to a character's death, even the small parts , their deaths really hit hard.",0,0
5361,I honestly think Treme's at times low stakes and meandering nature added a lot of realism.,0,0
5362,"I mean, you're dealing with a large part of the characters being blue collar musicians gigging and partying in post-Katrina New Orleans.",0,0
5363,It seemed very authentic to me in that regard.,0,0
5364,*But* that kind of thing isn't going to win over everyone. ,0,0
5365,&gt;one of the most realistic.,0,0
5366,"There's good reason as well, many stories, characters and the entire police system is based on the show's creator's time at the Baltimore Sun.",0,0
5367,"&gt;Simon has stated that he originally set out to create a police drama loosely based on the experiences of his writing partner Ed Burns, a former homicide detective.",0,0
5368,"Burns, when working on protracted investigations of violent drug dealers using surveillance technology, had often been frustrated by the bureaucracy of the Baltimore police department; Simon saw similarities with his own ordeals as a police reporter for The Baltimore Sun.",0,0
5369,You should!,0,0
5370,I just finished the first season for the second time and there is definitely stuff I missed the first time. ,0,0
5371,I do agree.,0,0
5372,But once you compare Treme to Show me a hero you start to run into the same issue.,0,0
5373,"Show me a Hero has a clear over arching plotline, its about the project housing, and the political conflict this creates.",0,0
5374,And every other plot thread informs the over-arching storyline.,0,0
5375,What was Treme really about?,0,0
5376,The musicians making costumes and preparing for Mardi Gras?,0,0
5377,The one laywer looking for that kid that probably got shot by the Police?,0,0
5378,The woman chef rediscovering her love for N'orleans?,0,0

5380,Or how the dyckes where mismanaged during the storm?,0,0
5381,Did anyone really know?,0,0
5382,"I doubt it, I think they just threw everything at the wall and then stuck with the storylines that interested them the most and pretty much abandoned the rest.",0,0

5387,I actually never watched the show.,0,0
5388,I am referring to that specific conversation in that specific clip.,0,0
5389,I actually left Youtube running and ended up watching the whole Omar plot.,0,0
5390,It was some of the best television I've seen in a very long time.,0,0
5391,I agree.,0,0
5392,It does show much more.,0,0
5393,"Before you do a rewatch, track down the DVD / rips with the commentary tracks.",0,0
5394,They're unbelievable.,0,0
5395,Easily some of the best commentary for a television series going. ,0,0
5396,I went in with low expectations and was still disappointed.,0,0
5397,I might watch one or two more episodes but if the first one was any indication it's going to be terrible.,0,0

5401,I've seen several opinions similar to this one and now I don't even wanna see the first episode for fear of how disappointed I'll be.,0,0
5402,I enjoyed it.,0,0

let the story progress a bit. ",0,0
5404,"Same, I want to give it a chance but it's so painful to watch already. ",0,0

5406,Katana girl seems that  it this season but other than that story line I thoroughly enjoyed it!,0,0
5407,Not season 1 heroes by any means but still better than a lot of the crap on tv! ,0,0

5414,"if you did, you're just a bad judge of quality",0,0
5415,"Not expected by any means, but sincerely hoped it wouldn't be terrible.",0,0
5416,So far not very good imo. ,0,0
5417,I liked it.,0,0

5419,"The katana girl, I liked it - it's a fantasy, why not.",0,0
5420,"Usually I'm pretty picky, but dunno, it worked for me.",0,0
5421,Oh the girl that can't be killed wasn't actually killed?,1,1
5422,What a twist!,1,1
5423,So weird that a show about people with widely varying powers would have someone that could enter a virtual world.,1,1
5424,Next you'll tell me there's a guy that can manipulate any technology by touching it.,1,1
5425,I thought it was much better than Heroes season 3-4.,1,1
5426,And most of 2.,1,1
5427,But katana girl is definitely my least favorite of the heroes shown so far.,1,1
5428,"I mean, she is able to enter a virtual world and reappear in other places in the real world so it's clearly not just the power to be a video game character.",1,1
5429,"I could be wrong, though.",1,1
5430,"It's not like the show has gone out of its way to remind the audience about Claire and that she was ""killed"" in the explosion.",1,1
5431,They alluded to them not knowing what happened and her dad had his memories of the event 'stolen'... Just hope they don't bring time travel into it again. ,0,0
5432,"Forget the video game shit, cause ya it was bad, but I was more outraged by how bad the cgi was than the power.",0,0
5433,"But what even outraged me more was...

A character's power is transporting stuff.",0,0
5434,But he has no idea how it works or where the objects go.,0,0

5443,"Thanks.""",0,0
5444,"I had to resist the urge to turn it off when I heard ""leeroy Jenkins"".",0,0
5445,"Also the effects look super low budget, which hopefully isn't due to wasting money on a fucking rediculous CG world. ",0,0
5446,Time travel is one of those Sci-Fi genies that is really tough to put back in the bottle.,0,0
5447,"It was one thing when Hiro could freeze time or manipulate it in tiny bits, but when he ended up back in Samurai Japan I knew it was not going away and was just going to get worse.",0,0
5448,Probably she survived but was disfigured genetically and her regeneration abilities worked but her face changed (i.e.,0,0
5449,we couldn't pay for hayden panettiere and/or she wasn't available).,0,0
5450,How fucking hard could it possibly be to rip off a good X-men storyline? ,0,0
5451,"Instead of Katana girl I would have done someone with powers when he/she dons a VR headset, would have been more current and shall I say, a little more believable?",0,0
5452,Why wouldn't we expect it to be good?,0,0
5453,"Heroes 1 was great, so why wouldn't this one be?",0,0
5454,I prefer to watch new shows with an open mind instead of pre-judging them.,0,0
5455,Yeah completely unengaging.,0,0
5456,"I had worried as much when I heard they would have the same writers, and many of the same characters.",0,0
5457,I won't be wasting my time with it.,0,0
5458,But his let him be the video game character in real life.,0,0
5459,Mostly in terms of swapping out guns and such.,0,0
5460,Better than I thought it would be so it has that going for it.,0,0
5461,I'll probably watch a couple of more episodes and see how I feel.,0,0
5462,They revealed it in the premiere.,0,0
5463,"(Actually, it may have been part 2 of the premiere, which is technically episode 2 since it was two episodes aired together rather than a two-hour long single episode if that distinction means anything.)",0,0
5464,Becoming a video game character may not be her actual power.,0,0
5465,"She has Hiro's sword, after all, and she can only get into the video game by unsheathing the sword.",0,0
5466,The sword originally allowed Hiro greater control over his powers.,0,0
5467,"And seeing as how the original show included a plot line on powered-people's powers evolving (e.g., Matt Parkman could originally only read minds but then he learned to erase memories and control people's actions), it's entirely possible that Hiro's powers also evolved and he eventually learned how to create pocket dimensions.",0,0
5468,Maybe the video game is actually a pocket dimension and the sword teleports Miko into this dimension so she can learn to use her actual powers safely there.,0,0
5469,"It's not necessarily a likely turn of events, but there are ways to save that plot line, even though it is easily the least interesting of the bunch right now, IMO.",0,0
5470,The final season of Heroes kind of did that.,0,0
5471,The main villain was very Magneto-esque.,0,0
5472,"There are some pretty great storylines that make up for the shitty ones, it evens out.",0,0
5473,That actually sounds pretty cool.,0,0
5474,When I heard about Reborn my mind originally thought they were just going to ripoff Future Past.,0,0
5475,"Well, if the time travel functioned like Doctor Who where he can't ever go back to somewhen he's been before, it's okay.",0,0
5476,He just has an excuse to see backstory or go on the occasional historical adventure.,0,0
5477,But paradoxes should be avoided.,0,0
5478,"Not to mention, if you're thinking of something and it goes there, you're almost definitely thinking of somewhere that you've been before.",0,0
5479,"That's also how he finds out his power at the end of the episode, but why hasn't he found his power in this manner before?",0,0
5480,"Also, he says that he thinks of the kid toy room when scared or angry, and he's on the move a lot because he can't control his power when scared or angry.",0,0
5481,Why is nothing else in the kid room when he teleports chuck and his wife there? ,0,0
5482,"It was very well executed, too.",0,0
5483,"Basically he would become delusional about his surroundings, thinking he was in a GTA-esque game. ",0,0
5484,"yeah, but like many of the ""powers"" in misfits, it turned out to be more of a curse, because while he was in it, he was an indiscriminate murderer, who confabulated real people for enemies in his game.",0,0
5485,"It's possible that the Primatech people just regularly clean out that room, removing the items that don't belong in there.",0,0
5486,Maybe that's what the balding guy was on his way to do when the couple attacked him.,0,0
5487,"It's weird because if someone sees/paints the future, that event is suddenly set in stone and cannot be changed no matter what.",0,0
5488,"But if you time travel to the past or future, you ARE able to change those events.",0,0
5489,"Personally, I'm a sucker for the Lost/Supernatural style time travel, i.e., you can only fulfill the past through time travel but you can't change it.",0,0
5490,"It takes a lot more forethought (which generally leads to stronger stories), and it eliminates all possible paradoxes (except the bootstrap paradox, but that's never a timeline-breaker).",0,0
5491,That sorta happened already.,0,0
5492,"When she appeared in the building lobby, she had fighting skills that she didn't have before.",0,0
5493,I would imagine that she will get some sort of extra power boost after she saves her dad. ,0,0
5494,"Time loops are my favourite way to involve time travel, like Prisoner of Azkaban and Time Crime.",0,0
5495,"She basically has Tron powers, which I kind of like.",0,0
5496,Especially since there probably won't be a Tron 3. ,0,0
5497,I thought the trailer for this week's episode at the end of the second hour hinted strongly that Claire was really dead.,0,0
5498,"Could be a red herring, of course, but with Hayden Panettiere doing Nashville for ABC, I doubt she's available.  ",0,0
5499,My main potential issue with the new show is that I'm not willing to wait all season for some big reveal/twist that will probably be a disappointment.,0,0
5500,"If they don't start telling me what's going on immediately, I'll probably bail. ",0,0
5501,The CGI is also appalling.,0,0
5502,In the scene where Chuck and the other woman infiltrate the Evo meeting and kill them all he lit a match... and threw it in a pool of blood which acted like gasoline... then the fire just spread out across the tile floor like water.,0,0
5503,The guy with super speed decides to run back and forth between two pillars just screaming while everyone else dies except the useless guy that takes longer to form a ball of fire than it does for Goku to make a spirit bomb... so bad.,0,0
5504,"So, I'm curious.",0,0
5505,"Why are all of the comments agreeing with you, yet the thread score is still at zero?",0,0
5506,"Two things I wondered, do they remove the blackboard every time they have to go into the room?",0,0

5509,"Didn't think of it as Hiro's sword so that's a bit interesting but still makes little sense to me, unless Japan is in Hiro's mind and it's all bullshit ",0,0

5511,Yeah I dunno lol but I'm glad I'm not the only one to notice the issues ,0,0

5513,"They should have just copied the power of the main character in ""The Gamer"" Manhwa",0,0

5515,It started as a humble drama focused on its admittedly simple characters and themes.,0,0
5516,It was interesting and relatable.,0,0
5517,"The parallel settings did a good job of reconnecting an adult, jaded viewer to the tropes and fantasies of classic fairy tales.",0,0
5518,"Sadly, the second season just tossed modesty aside and tried to focus fully on plotting and intrigue.",0,0
5519,The cast just could not support it.,0,0
5520,There wasn't enough depth to any of the characters for the obnoxious story lines to be worth caring about.,0,0
5521,All of the things that made Disney tales endearing were discarded for a watered-down imitation of mature drama.,0,0
5522,I gave up on the show by the end of season 2.,0,0
5523,I swear I always get so choked up every time Regina does something good.,0,0
5524,Or when she acts like she is going to do something evil but then she double crosses the bad guy and does good.,0,0
5525,I guess I always like to believe no matter how bad you become there is always redemption. ,0,0
5526,It's a shitshow.,0,0
5527,Season 1 was good.,0,0
5528,"The writers used to write for LOST, which I loved, but they brought all of the worst parts of LOST's writing without the story or actors to back it up. ",0,0
