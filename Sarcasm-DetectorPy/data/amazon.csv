After having three ipods I really wasn't looking for a Zune but a friend who likes Microsoft a lot bought me one for Christmas.,1,1,1,1
All in all a good story about getting what you pay for and paying for what you get.,5,3,1,4
Also they seem to not want to stay in my ear,4,1,2,5
Borrowing Friedman's use of analogies this is similar to the Amway pyramid scheme (ahem: Business Model) of me selling you soap then you selling it back to me: we both make money! Isn't that great!!,5,5,5,4
"Bottom line: if you want a book that will completely captivate and entertain you The Da Vinci Code is for you.""""",1,1,1,4

Brown seems to think twice about the intellect of his readers.,4,3,3,5
But at the current breath-taking price it seems to merely be the new Apple Newton.,3,2,5,4
By reading this book I now recognise what a brilliant writer John  Steinbeck is.,1,1,1,1
Coming back from iPhone and Palm and HTC i thought this N97 would be a breath in the fresh air.,1,5,1,1

Dumbledore seems to not want to make eye contact with Harry in this book.,2,5,1,5

First this is an insult to Christians and I do not recommend books that attack the faith of others.,1,1,1,1

For what these cost they are a disappointment!,1,5,1,4
Friends lent this renowned book to my wife while we were visiting them.,1,3,1,1
Garmin apparently does not care much about product quality or customer support.,1,2,1,5
Good luck guessing where the GPS wants you to go,5,5,5,5
"Guess what they said??? we dont replace phones with """"physical damage""""",5,5,2,5
However the price justifies the real quality the sound,1,1,1,3
I agree with all of the readers who give this book 1 star (or less if possible). ,3,1,3,1
I am a Nokia customer and enthusiastic for over a decade.,1,5,1,1
I am now onto my third Nuvi.,1,3,1,1
I bought Garmin Nuvi 200 series model which made my life miserable,2,2,3,5

I bought the Nuvi 260W as a gift.,3,1,1,1
I bought the Sony PRS-505 mainly because Kindle isn't available in Canada and Sony is.,1,1,5,1
I bought the Zune mostly so I wouldn't have to buy an iPod but I didn't do my homework well enough before I bought this product.,1,3,4,2
"I bought these speakers yesterday and tested them with my wife's Viewsonic High Definition 27"""" tv where I wanted more volume and full sound.",1,2,1,1
I bought this earbuds i was very exciting to use em but i hate to say that but the truth is they are even worse than dollar store earphones trust me or not completely Waste of time to read other review,4,5,2,5

I can't get enough volume out of it to even hear it at the gym... guess I'll need to be sending it back unless someone can tell me why it has no volume,5,5,1,5
I could have bought 3 to 4 pairs of the Sonys for what these cost,2,4,1,3
I did quite a bit of research before I purchased this phone as I always do. ,5,1,1,1
"I don't believe a product should label itself """"Noise Canceling"""" unless it truely does what it says",1,1,3,4
I don't know what kind of noise these headphones cancel but I haven't found anything yet,5,4,5,5
I expect a GPS to be a little more accurate than that,3,5,1,5
I feel like I put the money through the paper shredder I shelled out for these.,5,2,5,4
I followed the directions but I could not get the earphones to stay in my ears. ,1,1,3,3
I forked out over a hundred bucks after shipping and taxes so I knew I was in for a treat.  I was so wrong. ,5,4,4,4
I found the Sony MDR-NC6 to be worthless for reducing sound around you.,1,1,1,1
I guess Apple was sick of being undercut on video cables for the last-gen video iPod.,1,3,2,4
i guess i don't think very  brillantely.... well... it was ok... but not good to read just for fun..  cuz it's not fun...,2,3,3,5
I guess I enjoyed the book but only as a temporary diversion.,2,5,2,4
I guess I'm a member of the target audience for this camera --- it is my first SLR.,4,1,4,4
I guess if you really want to zoom in then you have to go to a big camera.,1,5,1,4
I guess it proves the saying that you get what you pay for,4,3,4,5
I guess it's just one of those books that everyone must read at least once in their lifetime.,2,1,1,5
I guess no wonder they were inexpensive because the ear pads are made out of foam and one's ears can feel the hard surface of the headphones.,5,3,2,5
I guess we'll just have to call it creative license.,5,3,5,5
I guess when your writing a seven book series one or two have to stick out as not being the favorites.,3,3,2,4
"I had been told that these were far superior to the phones that come with the ipod.  Unfortunately (to my ears) they sounded much more """"tinny"""".",4,4,1,3

I have two Zinwell ZAT-970A units and I'm having problems with both of them. ,4,4,1,1
I just got this box this morning from amazon and I already hate it!,4,1,1,4
I like it but am very disappointed that it excludes public libraries from the picture completely.,2,1,1,2
I love my Kindle but I have to leave my house and drive 10 minutes up the road to get it to work.,5,4,3,2
I purchased the Zinwell Zat-970A Converter Box and I wonder how many people out there have yet to realize the Channels they are missing out on with this Converter Box.,3,2,2,1
I read this book aloud to my son.,2,1,1,1
I suppose if you have read 2 books in your life one was the Da Vinci Code and the other one was I dunno let's say Nancy Drew and the Hidden Decoder Ring well then I guess DVC might be the best book that you have ever read.,1,4,5,4
I think they come with a free filter that omits all low range sounds so if you like listening to music with absolutely no Bass THESE HEADPHONES ARE FOR YOU,5,5,5,5
I usually trust Sony products but these did not cancel out noise.,1,5,1,2
I waited for this phone for a long time.,1,1,1,1
I was most intrigued when I saw this product on Good Morning America and went to Amazon to find out more.,1,1,1,1
I was quite disappointed in the podcast management of this item.,1,1,1,1

I've had mine for about 1 month and only had 3 CDs worth of music on it.,1,5,1,1
I've had my Zinwell converter box for two months and a few days ago it simply stopped working.,1,1,1,1
I've taken about 3000 pictures with this camera over several months.,1,3,1,1
if a product is defective from the get go the seller should pay all shipping...no wonder they longer sell this item...,3,5,1,3
If garmin married Googe maps we would really have something,5,4,4,5
If it were a little smaller it would be just like one of those little cheap toys we used to get out of the big bubble gum machines,5,5,4,5
If what you expect is a good literary treat and not a great plot and story this is for you.,4,5,4,4
If you are a power user don't buy this phone.,3,1,1,2
If you are under the age of 13 or have nostagia for the days when a good mystery required minimal brain effort then this Code's for you.,3,3,4,5

If you like sarcasm the book is for you.,2,1,5,4
If you like zero bass response and tinny sound to your music these are the earbuds for you,3,4,5,5
If you thought Eco's book was too hard and couldn't keep track of the references and you didn't really get that the point was that maniacs will make connections between any two objects no matter how distant and didn't understand that all the mad theories _are_ mad distortions of whatever historical data present themselves then this book is for you.,5,4,5,3
If you're looking for an easy to digest holiday read for those hung over mornings on the beach and you're easy to please maybe The Da Vinci Code does fit your bill.,1,4,4,5
"It just says """"acquiring satellite"""".  Great!",4,5,5,5
It never seems to go from sleep to just plain shutdown.,1,3,1,3
It seems to evoke either a very positive response from readers or a very negative one.,1,2,2,5
It seems to not find focus in some situations.,1,4,2,5
IT SITS COLLECTING DUST IN THE CLOSET,3,1,3,5
It sounded too good to be true - studio component earphones on sale at half-price! I,1,1,2,3
It took awhile until I could wear these without them hurting my ears,1,2,2,5
It's the first time that i bought a product and didn't work even once!,2,2,3,5
Its a very slim camera.,1,5,1,1
Just enjoy this erudite journey (although at last the journey seems to be an itinerary and somewhat a waste of time alas.),5,3,4,5
Let me tell you about why I DON'T like Harry Potter.,2,1,3,1
Let's start with what I don't need in a GPS device,4,1,2,4
Maybe these work for some people but my own experience with these is terrible,1,1,2,2
My MDR-NC6 headphones left ear piece failed after maybe 50 hours of use.,1,1,2,1
My only guess is that this book is selling on the sensationalism of the secret society.,3,2,3,3
My wife just got the Creative Zen Vision M last week but we have a problem already the Zen doesn't want to turn On or Off.,2,1,1,2
No matter what awards it has won I loath the interface on this thing.,2,1,1,1
Now I'm afraid to even try the higher-up model ... Shure what's happened??????????,5,2,4,4
obviously the quality is what I expected but at least they WORK.,5,5,3,3
Of course I bought the device knowing that I had problems with earlier purchases but like an idiot I went ahead,5,5,4,4
Ok I can get by then I bought a book and everytime I moved I would  hit the previous page tab...and back it would go...I guess until I get used to this... this is going to happen over and over again...,4,1,3,3
People who think these are great earphones must be severely hearing impaired,5,4,5,4
Product was on back order for a few days even though website said was in stock.,1,1,1,1
purchase of this Garmin 255W unit does NOT include the USB 010-10723-01 cable to connect the unit to your computer and unlike almost any other consumer product out there you cannot register your unit online or download additional options without this cabl,1,1,1,3
Should've paid attention to these reviews... and you should too!,1,4,1,5
Silly me the Kindle and the Sony eBook can't read these protected formats.  Great!,2,4,4,5
So...Unless you are a super techie genius that can master metatags and troubleshooting as well as operating a throughly confusing interface on the zune itself. Don't DO IT!!!,5,3,4,4
Sorry I bought this product - I should have bought the Apple 3GS - oh well,1,1,3,2
Sorry Shure if you want to charge the money you have to make a product that's worth it.,4,2,2,4
That's a Joke... Verizon is 100 time larger and doesn't need Garmin to sell phones!!,4,2,3,5
That's how it is. ... I guess it's the Pendulum's  business.,1,1,2,5
The author also seems to have forgotten that punctuation exists in English language resulting in choppy short sentences reminiscent of a High School English writing assignment.,5,5,4,4
The best I can say of the book is that I could not put it down after I began reading it.,1,3,3,1
The book Harry Potter and the sorcerers stone is a good book written by J.K Rowling.,1,1,1,1
The book's plot is very good.,1,1,1,1
The camera is terrific for close-ups but not for landscapes.,1,1,3,2
The fifth book of the Harry Potter series brings a little bit disappointment to me.,1,1,2,1
The Garmin GPS has some major flaws one being that its software is unstable and sometimes needs to be totally reinstalled after an attempted update.,1,1,1,1
The Garmin Nuvi 255W stopped working halfway through our trip overland to 4 states and had to buy another GPS more humble but not failed us at all.,1,2,1,1
The item I received is not working and it seems that I cannot return it for another and since I used the card ($40.00) I will have purchase another.,1,1,1,2
The new unit works just fine...so far,2,3,2,5
The only formats I miss are Real Video and iTunes (though for latter I guess I can't really blame Creative).,4,2,3,5
The phone only worked for two months and then the screen went black.,1,1,1,2
The SE110 is a horrible earbud for the price.,1,2,2,1
The Sony ebook reader is not perfect which is why I didn't give it five stars. ,1,1,3,1
The sound quality is fine - you get what you pay for,2,1,2,4
The universal opinion I'd heard before reading this was that it was good but had a more serious feel and was too long.,1,1,1,1
The Zune has a nice selection of music and I like the way you can put pictures on it.,1,1,1,1
The Zune is a fair music player not the best and not the worst.,1,1,1,1
There are cheaper cameras but if you want to get a camera get a good one that doesn't mean it has to be expensive but in my opinion you get what you pay for.,1,1,2,3
These earphones have a nice sound but they use inferior insulation in the wires.,3,1,1,2
These may have been defective I'm not sure but they didn't do the job.,1,2,2,2
They are not the worse earphones I have tried but they are not worth the $ 99 you will spend.,4,1,2,2
They assured me that despite all the frenzy surrounding the book it was great!,1,2,4,5
They do have some noise reducing abilities but it isn't really worth the price or the pain,4,2,5,4
They sound great while they remain in your ear but keeping them in your ear is the problem,3,4,3,5
This book in the series is far too slow and isnt worth the wait.,1,1,1,1
This book is a good quick read but I guess it cannot live up to the hype....,3,5,1,5
This book is about two hobos named George and Lennie.,4,1,1,1
This book was one of the worst books I have ever read.,2,1,1,1
this book was overall disappointing.,1,1,1,1
This book was pretty much a waste of time.,1,1,2,1
This book was the worst!,1,1,2,1
This device was received in a timely manner.,1,1,1,1
This IPOD has a lot of problems and in my opinion is NOT worth the inflated cost.,1,1,1,1
this is not a good book...period!!,1,1,1,2
This is the most disjointed story I have ever read.,1,1,1,1
THIS ISN'T BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE IT'S ZERO CUSTOMER SERVICE,3,5,5,5
This novel is interesting but I found the style to be tedious and unsophisticated to no real end.,1,1,1,1
This phone is mostly to be kept under a glass display in the living room as it does not easily survive regular use,5,4,5,4
This second generation device is twice as fast as its PRS-500 predecessor and it has eight black and white shades instead of the previous 4.,1,1,1,1
To be frank Apple should pay us to accept this product push software,3,5,4,5
to tell you the truth I was pretty disapointed with this one.,1,1,1,1
Unless you are VERY patient and VERY much enjoy fiddling with this sort of thing in other words unless you are downright masochistic STAY AWAY from this gadget from hell.,5,4,5,5
Very little bass compared to my existing earpods for my iPod.,1,1,1,1
Very recently I've purchased a Creative Zen 30GM player.,1,1,1,1
Well you know what happened. ALMOST NOTHING HAPPENED!!!!,5,4,5,3
When getting iTunes running again iTunes said that the iPod needed to be restored.,3,1,3,1
when i got it i was excited a cool package a great fit and thick cable... but the bass was just NOT THERE,1,4,2,4
While I know you get what you pay for the list price belies the quality of the product.,2,2,3,3
Who ever said this book was not just for kids is crazy.,4,4,3,1
With tons of great literature why is this the best-selling fiction novel of all time?  I guess because it's easy to finish.,2,3,3,5
